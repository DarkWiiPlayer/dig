## DarkWiiPlayer/Dig

General utility package for CC:Tweaked mining turtles.

Installation:

```
wget run https://darkwiiplayer.github.io/dig/install.lua
```

Updating afterwards:

```
dig/install
```

Note: after adding new files, the first execution of `dig/install` will not
grab the new files, but download an updated version of itself with the new file
list. Running it a second time will then download all the files.
